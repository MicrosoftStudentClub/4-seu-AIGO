# 4-seu-AIGO
Implementation of MobileNet and ResNet on tensorflow1.7.0. 

# MobileNet
This implementation of [MobileNets: Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks for Mobile Vision Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861) is designed to be straightforward and friendly to MobileNet freshman. 
# ResNet
This implementation of [Resnet:Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) is designed to be straightforward and friendly to Resnet freshman. 

# Visual Studio Tools for AI 
This implementation is built on Visual Studio Tools for AI, which is a free Visual Studio extension to build, test, and deploy deep learning / AI solutions.More information in [VS Tools for AI](https://github.com/Microsoft/vs-tools-for-ai).
